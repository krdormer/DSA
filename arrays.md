# Data Structures
## Arrays
1. Smallest 'footprint'
2. Organizes data sequentially in memory
    - Contiguous
3. Items are stored and accessed via a numerical index, starting at 0
    - Key/value pairs where the key is always numerical
4. Performance
    1. Access / Lookup
	* O(1) - Constant time
	* `arr[0]` => returns item at zeroth position in array
